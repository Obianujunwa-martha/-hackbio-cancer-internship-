**Track 3: Data Science and Machine Learning**

**_5 Bioinformatics databases for cancer         _**

     Decades of research have produced mounting data that suggests cancer is a genetic illness (Yang Y. et al, 2015). The study of information analysis using cutting-edge statistical, computational, simulation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence methods is the main goal of the area of **data science** (Oxford Cancer). The more we understand about the complex and constantly evolving nature of cancer, the more effective its treatment and prognosis will be. Data science contributes to the progress of cancer research and therapy.

     In order to predict patient responses and treatment plans, **machine learning** entails developing models and algorithms that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions on their own without the need for explicit programming instructions. This is achieved by feeding large amounts of data to an algorithm, which allows the algorithm to find patterns and connections within the data (Yaqoob, A. et al, 2023). Other applications of machine learning include the classification of cancer types, the identification of potential biomarkers, and the improvement of understanding of tumor heterogeneity (Purwono, P. et al, 2023).

**_5 Bioinformatics databases for cancer<a id="_GoBack"></a>_**

**1.      cBioPortal**

Researchers may examine, interpret, and analyze multidimensional cancer genomics data using the easily navigable cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (Gao J. et al. 2013). Notably, original molecular profile data from cancer tissues and cell lines are processed by cBioPortal into smaller datasets (Yang Y, et al. 2015). In order to provide users with graphical summaries of large-scale cancer genomic data in an intuitive manner, it integrates and streamlines data related to somatic mutation, mRNA and microRNA expression, DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) and methylation, protein, and phosphoprotein RPPA data (Zheng H. et al. 2020).

**2.      UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser    **

A tool for storing, displaying, and analyzing data on cancer genomes and clinical research is the UCSC Cancer genomes Browser, an online analytical tool (Goldman M et al). Its goal is to efficiently show and analyze clinical and genetic data related to cancer, offering cancer researchers and the larger scientific community a platform to present these data in an integrated system (Zhu J. et al. 2009).

**3.      MethyCancer**

DNA methylation is linked to tumor suppressor gene silencing, chromosomal instability, and oncogene activation, all of which are important factors in the development of cancer. MethyCancer is intended to explain how DNA methylation, gene expression, and cancer are related to one another. MethyCancer houses data on (1) DNA methylation, (2) CNV and cancer information, (3) CpG Island clones, and (4) the correlations between these datasets (Yang Y. et al. 2015). The data could help researchers determine epigenetic patterns (He, X. et al. 2008).

**4.      Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer**

The greatest publicly available resource on drug sensitivity and drug response in cancer cells is found in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. To find molecular indicators of cancer therapy response, the COSMIC database's extensive genomic datasets were combined with data on cell line drug sensitivity. The obtained data are offered for viewing and downloading in a number of graphical formats (Yang W. et al. 2013).****

**5.      Cancer Genome Work Bench           **

With an emphasis on gene expression and mutations, CNV, and methylation, the Cancer Genome Work Bench (CGWB) is a useful resource. For users to see and examine genomic data and gene expression changes in every sample, it offers an automated analysis workflow (Yang Y. et al. 2015). Integrating clinical tumor mutation profiles with reference human genomes is a first for this computer platform. Genomic variation and methylation may be readily compared with patient clinical data by users (Zhang J. et al. 2007).
